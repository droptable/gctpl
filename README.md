C Template Generator
--------------------

This little script builds a source and header file to work with fcgi (f.e.) for C/C++ (no class support yet) from templates (multiple sources possible) and was written in the first place for FastPoll (https://github.com/droptable/fastpoll).

It is written for python3, so you'll need version >=3.

If you need any help or have some advice for improvement, don't hestitate to let me know.

###Template format
```
EXAMPLE_CONSTANT:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>foobar</title>
  </head>
  <body>

EXAMPLE_RENDER_FUNC:
<p id="{id_var:%d}">{str_var:%s}</p>

```

As you can see, there are two types of definitions which will be generated by this template: Constants, or more precisely preprocessor macros, and functions. The first one is a simple macro, the second one will generate a function because it expects arguments (id_var and str_var).

Arguments are always between {} and formatted like this: {VAR_NAME:VAR_FORMATTING}. The available formatting types are mostly the same ones printf() uses (take a look at the format_translation_table for further information) and are translated into their respective c types if needed (%d -> int, %u -> unsigned int, ..).
